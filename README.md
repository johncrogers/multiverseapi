# multiverseapi
An API for the Magic the Gathering multiverse.
The focus of this application is centered around UX. Specifically with regard to the search and filter experience. Magic the Gathering has over 35,000 individual items and the current solutions avaiable for card search are cumbersome. This interface is intended to decrease the necessary effort required to traverse the multiverse. Those interested in contributing please reach out.
